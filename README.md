You can also access to the report from our flask application. To run it, pull the repository, do into the folder "Flaskapp".
Before running app.py, upload the model with the drive link we will send you in coursework. Put the folder models into the folder Flask.
Then run from the command shell : python app.py

You made need to install some dependencies. We could do a pip freeze but im the environment we worked with, there are more packages than those required so just pip install the dependencies you need. (One you may note have is "pip install imgaug".

Once you run the python app.py, the web app will run it the address indicated in the command shell.
This website present the projet and by clicking on learn more you will load the report.

If you want to test the app yourselve, we can send you a small sample of images but we don't have the authorization to share the dataset (yet..).

If you have any problem to run the app, send us an email : ac4391@columbia.edu

Also, you can visit the first landing page, without the model, we deployed on the following address (only you can't run the flask app and wait . for our reply):

We'd like to thank every teaching staff for the ADL class. We have learned so much and had a great time working on this project.

PS : Because of my plane to Paris, I had to leave whereas the video was yet to finish recording. That's why you don't hear my voice in the video (Ariel).
